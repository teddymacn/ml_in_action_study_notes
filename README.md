# The book "Machine Learning in Action" study notes.

The purpose of this repo is to keep my notes when studying the book "Machine Learning in Action". This is a great book, introducing many common machine learning algorithms with demo code in python 2.X. To be fair, the code of this book is good enough as demos of each chapter. But as an audience like me, a more-than-15-year-experience developer, who want to apply these machine learning algorithms in potential real projects, I always want to revise the implementation of each algorithm in my own style, be python 3.X compatible, with more practical libraries, with more managable code styles, etc. In short, I want my implmentation to be more friendly for a developer like me to reference & apply. 

Furthermore, for most of the algorithms mentioned in this book, there are many common general purpose implementations in many high level machine learning frameworks. So beside a revised version of each algorithm, I also try to provide an additional implementation of the same problem with a high level machine learning framework, which might be a more practical way if we want to try on these algorithms efficiently in real life.
